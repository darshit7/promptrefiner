## üìö Research on Prompt Techniques

Prompt engineering is an evolving field, and several research papers explore techniques that enhance interactions with language models. Below are some key papers that discuss various **prompting strategies** and their applications.

We aim to incorporate insights from these research papers and resources like [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) into `promptrefiner`, aligning its prompt-enhancement strategies with **state-of-the-art methodologies** in prompt engineering.
